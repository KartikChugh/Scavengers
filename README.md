## A 2D Roguelike Experience

Complete with procedural tile-based levels, turn-based movement, hunger mechanics, and old-school graphics and audio.

### Every day is a struggle to survive. 

Use WASD / arrow keys to manuever a lone adventurer as he journeys through a long and dangerous dungeon. Goblins await, ready to pounce, but food and drinks replenish our brave hero.

### Each level is its own puzzle.

No two levels are alike, thanks to the magic of procedural generation. Devise clever paths (or forge new ones) that acquire food, evade foes, and lead you to the escape â€” but be sure not to burn your hunger bar in the process!

Made in Unity 5 with the help of a [Unity Learn tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial) and custom tweaks to mechanics/audio.

### Maze Venturer

A [maze-based variant](https://simmer.io/@kc7/maze-venturer/) of Scavengers was nominated for the Simmer.io Founder's Club. It's significantly more challenging, as each move must be rationed carefully.
