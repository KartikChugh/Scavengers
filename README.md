## A 2D Roguelike Experience

Complete with procedural tile-based levels, turn-based movement, hunger mechanics, and event-driven audio!

### Every day is a struggle to survive. 

Use WASD / arrow keys to manuever a lone adventurer, **Halen**, as he journeys through a long and dangerous dungeon. 
<br> Goblins await, ready to pounce, but food and drinks replenish our brave hero.

### A new level is its own puzzle.

No two levels are alike, thanks to the magic of procedural generation. 
<br> Devise clever paths (or forge new ones) that acquire food and evade foes â€” but be sure not to burn your hunger bar in the process!
