## A 2D Roguelike Experience

Complete with procedural tile-based levels, turn-based movement, hunger mechanics, and old-school graphics and audio.

### Every day is a struggle to survive. 

Use WASD / arrow keys to manuever a lone adventurer, **Halen**, as he journeys through a long and dangerous dungeon. Goblins await, ready to pounce, but food and drinks replenish our brave hero.

### Each level is its own puzzle.

No two levels are alike, thanks to the magic of procedural generation. Devise clever paths (or forge new ones) that acquire food and evade foes â€” but be sure not to burn your hunger bar in the process!
